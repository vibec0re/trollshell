//! Polled S-Bahn departures from S Schöneweide, sourced from
//! v6.bvg.transport.rest.
//!
//! A 15-minute tokio loop fetches the next 8 suburban-rail departures and
//! exposes them through a [`Mutable<DeparturesState>`]. Consumers subscribe
//! via [`current()`]. The sidebar's open-edge handler nudges [`refresh()`]
//! to keep the freshly-opened list current without waiting for the next
//! poll tick.
